# GitHub Actions Workshop

## Preparation

- Make sure you have a GitHub Account.
- Fork this repository: https://github.com/TNG-GitHub-Actions-Workshop/gh-actions-workshop. Don't change the name of the repository!
- Make sure you have Node.js 20 installed.
- Clone the repository locally.
  - Install all project dependencies with `npm ci`.
  - Run tests with `npm run test` and run the dev server with `npm run dev`.
  - Open http://localhost:5173/gh-actions-workshop/ in your browser.
- Perform `Exercise 1`. Make sure this triggered a workflow run in your repository by checking the Actions Tab.
- Don't be afraid of JavaScript/TypeScript. We'll just use this small small project to build an awesome GitHub Actions setup.
